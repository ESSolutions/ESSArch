In ESSArch Preservation Platform (EPP) many list views includes nested IPs
which can be expanded to see the underlying IPs. What should appear in the
first level can be administrated in the :ref:`user settings
<user-settings-ip-view-type>`.

The main functionality of a view, such as preparation, creation and
preservation, is accessed by clicking on a row in the IP list.
