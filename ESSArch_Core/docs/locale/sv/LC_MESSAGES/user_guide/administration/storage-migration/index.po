"The storage medium list has two filtering options, storage policy and "
"medium ID (single or range). Mediums can be filtered by storage policy "
"which is initially set to the first storage policy. The storage policy "
"filter is required and will always have a value to ble able to populate "
"the storage medium list. The medium ID filter has two different "
"variations. The first option is to search and select on single storage "
"medium which filters out selected medium. The second is for filtering out"
" a range of mediums. The medium ID range filter can be activated by "
"checking the checkbox labeled **Enter medium ID range**. This checkbox "
"also disables the single medium ID option and clears it's value. The "
"range filter allows a user to select the first and last medium ID by "
"searching and selecting medium IDs. When unchecking the checkbox the "
"range filter is disabled and its values are cleared in favor of single "
"medium ID filtering."
